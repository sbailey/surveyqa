FITS files contain multiple \"Header Data Units\" (HDUs), where each HDU contains an ASCII \"header\" with keyword/value pairs of metadata followed by binary data that can be either an N-dimensional array or a table with named columns and rows of data.

It is approximately 1/cos(theta) where theta=the angle measured from straight up (the \"zenith\").  e.g. looking at 30 degrees above the horizon = 60 degrees from the zenith means airmass = 1/cos(60) = 2, i.e. looking through twice as much atmosphere as looking straight up.  Generally we want to observe through less air.\n",

Seeing less than 1 arcsec is generally pretty good; seeing greater than 1 arcsec is a somewhat disappointing night.  For comparison, a human with good eyesight has effective seeing of 1 arcminute = 60 arcsec.  i.e. a good telescope can see ~60x sharper than a human."

When zoomed out, this gives the impression that we are done with a large fraction of sky, but if you zoom in you will see that there are many unobserved gray tile locations that are obscured by the blue points.  How could you represent the data to give a better sense of actual completion for each part of the sky?"
